The move signals united opposition to President Trump’s push to take control of the island.\n\nFour parties joined forces, holding 23 of 31 seats, excluding only Naleraq. The timing of the deal aims to show defiance toward U.S. efforts seen as disrespectful and aggressive.\n\nDwayne Ryan Menezes, founder and managing director of the Polar Research & Policy Initiative, said: “The new coalition agreement… will signal to the Vances… the unity forged in defiance.”",
