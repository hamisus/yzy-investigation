  "text": "University of Toronto scientists have created 0.1-inch robotic tools powered by magnetic fields that can perform brain surgery without scalpels. Guided by external coils, the tools grip, cut, and remove tissue through a small opening, reducing pain and scarring.\n\nTested on brain-like models made of tofu and raspberries, the tools delivered more precise cuts than hand tools and had a 76% success rate gripping targets. They mimic surgeon hand motions on a tiny scale without motors or cables.\n\nProfessor Eric Diller said: “It’s a radically different approach… but it’s also one that can lead to capabilities that are far beyond what we can do today.”",
