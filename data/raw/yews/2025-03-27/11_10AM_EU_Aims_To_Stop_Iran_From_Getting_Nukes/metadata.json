  "text": "EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the bloc’s top goal in the Middle East is preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. She warned of Tehran’s support for Russia, hybrid attacks on Europe, and backing of Hamas.\n\nDuring her visit to Israel, Kallas pushed for stronger ties and said Hamas should be excluded from Gaza’s future government. She backed a two-state solution and urged Arab nations to fund Gaza’s reconstruction.\n\nKallas rejected forced Palestinian displacement and said there is no EU plan to sanction Israel, only discussions on sanctioning violent settlers.",
