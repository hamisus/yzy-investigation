They were spotted walking on the ice and rescued with only minor injuries.\n\nThe Piper PA-12 left Soldotna Airport for a sightseeing trip but never returned. Search teams and locals joined the effort, with a Good Samaritan spotting the wreckage and the survivors.\n\nRescuer Dale Eicher said: “I didn’t expect that we would find them alive for sure… it doesn’t always turn out this well.”",
