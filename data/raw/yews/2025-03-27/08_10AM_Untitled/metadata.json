  "text": "Israel has killed Ismail Barhoum, the newly appointed Hamas prime minister, in a precision airstrike on Nasser Hospital in Gaza. He replaced Issam Da’alis, who was killed days earlier in another Israeli strike.\n\nThe IDF said Barhoum used the hospital as a base for terror activity, not medical care. He was the fourth senior Hamas figure eliminated in 24 hours, alongside two top commanders and a political bureau member.\n\nDefense Minister Katz said operations will “continue and expand” until hostages are freed. Israeli forces are preparing for a major ground push as Hamas signals limited interest in a new hostage deal.\n\nCol. Avichay Adraee warned Rafah residents to evacuate ahead of fresh attacks, as Israeli troops advanced rapidly on multiple fronts in Gaza.",
