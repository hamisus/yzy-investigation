  "text": "Tech startup Jetson has completed the first test flight of its production-ready flying car, the SN1, which hovered in place without pilot control on March 25, 2025. The personal aircraft is certified to fly in Italy and will begin deliveries in 2026.\n\nThe SN1 features a race-car-style safety cell, eight exposed rotors, and flight-stabilizing tech that lets it stay airborne even if a motor fails. It includes radar sensors, an auto-landing system, and a ballistic parachute for emergencies.\n\nThe single-seat vehicle flies for 20 minutes at up to 63 miles per hour and is controlled with a four-axis joystick using one hand.",
