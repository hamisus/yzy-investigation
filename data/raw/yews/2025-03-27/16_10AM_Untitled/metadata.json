  "text": "A record 4.8% of Americans took hardship withdrawals from their 401(k)s in 2024, up from 3.6% in 2023, according to Vanguard. Rising living costs, depleted savings, and looser federal rules are driving the increase.\n\nExperts warn that early withdrawals trigger a 10% penalty plus income taxes, reducing the actual payout and harming long-term retirement security. A $10,000 withdrawal, for example, could result in over $1,000 lost to penalties alone.\n\nStill, average account balances hit $148,200—up 10% from last year—and nearly half of savers raised their contribution rates, showing long-term resilience despite financial strain.",
