He began painting in his 80s, inspired by French impressionists like Cézanne.\n\nAfter two years of still-life training, Heydon found joy in expressing memories through oil painting. Now, with encouragement from his teacher, he’s proudly displaying his work for the first time.\n\nHeydon said: “The sun is shining, God’s in heaven — all is right in the world.”",
