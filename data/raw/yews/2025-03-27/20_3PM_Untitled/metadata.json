  "text": "Renewables accounted for 92.5% of all new global power capacity in 2024, adding 585 GW—15.1% growth from 2023. Solar led with 452 GW, followed by wind with 113 GW, making up 96.6% of renewable expansion.\n\nChina drove 64% of global growth, while G7 nations made up just 14.3%. Despite record gains, the world still needs to reach 11,200 GW by 2030—requiring annual growth of 16.6% to stay on climate track.\n\nIRENA’s Francesco La Camera said: “The continuous growth of renewables… is evidence that renewables are economically viable and readily deployable.”\n\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres said: “Renewables renew economies… but the shift to clean energy must be faster and fairer.”",
