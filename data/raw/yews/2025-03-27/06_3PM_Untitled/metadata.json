The experiment takes place in France and simulates space by suspending bodies in warm water without letting them stand.\n\nParticipants eat, bathe, and use the bathroom while horizontal, with no visitors allowed. The study aims to improve care for astronauts, seniors, and bedridden patients by examining how weightlessness affects muscles, bones, fluids, and vision.",
