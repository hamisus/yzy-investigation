  "title": "Nigerian Farmers Turn To Solar Pumps",
  "text": "Farmers in northeast Nigeria are switching to solar-powered irrigation to survive rising fuel costs and worsening floods. The shift has cut expenses, boosted crop yields, and lowered local food prices, but high setup costs and theft remain major barriers.\n\nMany abandoned petrol pumps after extreme weather—linked to climate change—repeatedly destroyed crops. With no government aid, farmers rely on loans or savings to buy solar panels, often hauling them daily to prevent theft.\n\nDespite challenges, demand for solar tech is growing fast. Experts say this transition is vital for food security and cutting emissions in Africa’s climate-vulnerable regions.",
