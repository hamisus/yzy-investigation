  "text": "Archaeologists have uncovered ancient garden remains beneath the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, supporting the Gospel of John’s account of Jesus’ burial near a garden. Pollen and soil samples revealed olive trees and grapevines from around 2,000 years ago.\n\nThe excavation began in 2022 as part of a rare renovation, requiring approval from the church’s three custodians and Israel’s Antiquities Authority. Researchers also found pottery, oil lamps, and burial sites spanning from the Iron Age to early Christianity.\n\nA marble base matching early church descriptions and stone walls filled with soil were discovered, suggesting a quarry turned garden before becoming a burial site. A digital reconstruction is underway, with final excavations set to resume after Easter.\n\nThe lead archaeologist said: “The Gospel mentions a green area between the Calvary and the tomb, and we identified these cultivated fields.”",
