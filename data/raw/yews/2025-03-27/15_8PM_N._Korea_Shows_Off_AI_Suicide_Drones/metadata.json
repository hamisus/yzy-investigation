  "text": "North Korea’s Kim Jong Un inspected new AI-powered suicide drones and approved plans to boost production. Analysts say Russia likely helped develop the drones, deepening military ties between the two nations.\n\nThe drones, first revealed in 2024, are loitering munitions designed to crash into targets with built-in warheads. Kim also unveiled North Korea’s first airborne early-warning aircraft, which may also use Russian parts.\n\nDrone expert James Patton Rogers warned: “North Korea is hinging very clearly on a drone future for its military.”",
