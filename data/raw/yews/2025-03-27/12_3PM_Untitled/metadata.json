  "text": "BlackRock has added its $1.7 billion tokenized money market fund to Solana, bringing its blockchain reach to seven networks. The move lets crypto investors earn yield while parking cash on-chain, with faster, 24/7 access than traditional markets.\n\nThe BUIDL fund holds cash and Treasury bills and is part of a broader push toward asset tokenization. BlackRock’s crypto efforts include a spot-Bitcoin ETF launched in January that now holds nearly $40 billion.\n\nSecuritize COO Michael Sonnenshein said: “We are advancing and leapfrogging some of the quote-unquote deficiencies that money markets may have in their traditional formats.”\n\nSolana Foundation President Lily Liu said: “You can do more things with those assets on chain than you could if [they’re] sitting in your brokerage account.”",
