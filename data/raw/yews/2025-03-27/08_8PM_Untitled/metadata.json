  "text": "China has developed a deep-sea device capable of cutting armored undersea cables that carry 95% of global internet traffic. The tool, built for crewed and uncrewed submersibles, can operate at depths of 13,123 feet—twice the depth of most subsea infrastructure.\n\nThough billed as a resource development tool, experts warn it could be used to target critical chokepoints like Guam, risking global communication outages. The diamond-tipped cutter runs on low power and is precise enough for stealth use by robotic arms.\n\nThe South China Sea tool adds to China’s expanding undersea dominance, raising fresh security concerns.",
