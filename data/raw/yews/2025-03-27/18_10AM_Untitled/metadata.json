  "text": "Several European countries have warned citizens that U.S. travel could pose risks for “non-binary travelers” under a new White House policy requiring passports to match sex at birth. The rule reverses a 2022 decision allowing “X” gender markers.\n\nFrance, Germany, Britain, Denmark, and Finland updated their travel advisories, citing reports of detentions and entry refusals. Germany confirmed some of its citizens were already stopped at the border.\n\nThe State Department said current passports remain valid, but those with mismatched gender markers may face delays, questioning, or expulsion at U.S. entry points.",
