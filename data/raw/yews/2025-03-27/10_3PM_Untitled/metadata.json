Vice President JD Vance will visit a U.S. military base there Friday, after canceling stops in Nuuk and a dog sled race.\n\nGreenland’s prime minister called the visit “aggressive” and warned the U.S. cannot pressure or buy the island. Denmark’s defense minister supported scaling back the trip.\n\nTrump said: “If we don’t have Greenland, we can’t have great international security.”",
