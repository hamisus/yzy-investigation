  "text": "UNICEF has prevented the collapse of two-thirds of Afghanistan’s healthcare system by running 96 hospitals and 2,400 clinics with 28,000 staff and 32,000 volunteers. The effort has supported over 2.2 million births since 2021.\n\nWorking mostly in remote valleys, volunteers provide critical care, vaccinations, and health education to communities once isolated from modern medicine. Their presence is building trust and saving lives.\n\nToday, over half of Afghans receive basic care through UNICEF programs, with three-quarters accessing hospital-level services—mostly serving women and children.",
