  "text": "A Kansas babysitter found a man hiding under a child’s bed after the child said a “monster” was there. When she checked, she came face-to-face with 27-year-old Martin Villalobos Jr., who fled after knocking over her and the child.\n\nDeputies arrested him the next day after a foot chase. Villalobos, who used to live on the property, had a protection order barring him from the home. He now faces charges including aggravated kidnapping and child endangerment.\n\nHe is being held in Barton County Jail on $500,000 bond.",
