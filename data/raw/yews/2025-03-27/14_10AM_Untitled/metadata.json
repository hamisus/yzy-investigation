  "text": "A surge in “Studio Ghibli-style” AI images has overwhelmed OpenAI’s new GPT-4o model, delaying its image generation rollout to free ChatGPT users. The tool, available to paid tiers, lets users transform photos into anime-style art with a single prompt.\n\nCEO Sam Altman admitted demand exceeded expectations, posting: “Rollout to our free tier is unfortunately going to be delayed for awhile.” GPT-4o can edit, combine, and stylize uploaded images natively, without relying on external models.\n\nSome fans and Studio Ghibli creator Hayao Miyazaki have criticized the AI trend, citing concerns over originality and ethics, but the viral appeal shows no signs of slowing.",
