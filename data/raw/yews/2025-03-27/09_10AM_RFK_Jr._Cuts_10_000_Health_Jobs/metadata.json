  "text": "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced 10,000 layoffs—cutting 25% of the department’s staff—as part of his “Make America Healthy Again” plan to fight chronic disease. The cuts follow buyouts from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe FDA, CDC, and NIH will see the largest job losses as the agency restructures from 28 divisions to 15, including a new “Administration for a Healthy America.” Kennedy claims the overhaul will save $1.8 billion a year.\n\nCritics warn the move risks worsening disease outbreaks, citing Kennedy’s anti-vaccine stance, past denial of germ theory, and promotion of avian flu spread to breed “immune” birds. Some speculate artificial intelligence will replace these critical roles.",
