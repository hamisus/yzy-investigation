  "text": "Builders are turning to 3D printing, factory-built homes, and hempcrete to ease America’s housing shortage. These methods aim to lower costs and speed up production amid high rents and a shortfall of millions of homes.\n\nColorado-based Fading West builds modular homes in 5–7 days, delivering move-in ready units within six weeks. They’ve built over 500 homes, mostly for workers priced out of resort towns.\n\n3D printed homes use concrete layers and could reduce labor costs, but the tech is costly and not yet widely approved. Hempcrete, a mix of hemp and lime, replaces multiple wall materials and was added to U.S. building codes last year.\n\nEric Schaefer of Fading West said: “The faster you build — even at a high quality — means the lower the price.”",
