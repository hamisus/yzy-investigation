  "text": "Hamas has “responded positively” to a new Egyptian deal offering the release of five Israeli hostages, including an American-Israeli soldier, in exchange for a seven-week ceasefire. Israel would also free hundreds of prisoners and restore large-scale aid to Gaza.\n\nThe proposal includes deeper talks on releasing remaining hostages and a phased IDF withdrawal from Gaza. Israel noted “slight positive indications” but said major gaps remain.\n\nThe Tikva Forum opposed the deal, saying: “The Israeli government must take them all out at once… and until then increase military pressure.”",
